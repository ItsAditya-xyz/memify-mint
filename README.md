## Inspiration
We all love memes. How about a platform where you can discover trending memes of the Internet based on topic and mint them as NFT after change in caption? Sounds cool, unpractical and not needed as why would anyone want to mint NFT of their memes? Welcome to the Meme Economy of 21st century!

## What it does
- Memify is a platform where you can discover funny viral memes of the Internet, edit its caption and mint them as NFT. Minting as NFT is really not required but why not just do some impractical things?
- The landing page and the whole discovery feed of memes is built using Wix and Velo. And we are using Deso Blockchain for minting the memes as NFT

## How we built it
- For the first time we used Wix and Velo, which was a new tech for all of us still we achieved it using the documentation and by doing mistakes

## Challenges we ran into
- Since we used Wix for the first time so we didn't knew where to start from. Had a hard time in doing what we exactly wanted to do


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We were able to execute what we thought of initially and liked it
- We were able to use and understand Wix and Velo, which was new to us all along

## What we learned
- We learnt Wix along with Velo
- We learnt blockchain **DeSo** along the way
- We learnt to divide the work among us and work as a team



## What's next for Memify
We think Memfiy can be what people say about "Meme Economy" can be. A platform where people can discover memes, make new ones, monetize their meme creation with NFT and many more exciting stuffs!
